# Deploying FastAPI with Gunicorn and Uvicorn Workers

## Goals

- Achieve efficient and scalable request handling.
- Leverage asynchronous processing capabilities.
- Ensure robust and reliable process management.

## Task

Deploy a FastAPI application using Gunicorn as the application server with Uvicorn workers to handle asynchronous requests in a production environment.

## Reasons

- **Process Management**: Utilize Gunicorn's mature process management for handling multiple worker processes.
- **Asynchronous Support**: Benefit from Uvicorn's high-performance asynchronous processing for improved performance.
- **Scalability**: Handle increased traffic efficiently by running multiple workers.
- **Performance**: Achieve high throughput and low latency in request handling.
- **Flexibility**: Customize server configurations to suit specific application needs.

## Solutions

### 1. Direct Launch with Command

Use a straightforward launch command for quick setup:

```bash
gunicorn main:main_app --workers 4 --worker-class uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker --bind 0.0.0.0:8000
```

To implement this option in a `Dockerfile`, specify the command using CMD:

```Dockerfile
CMD ["gunicorn", "main:app", "--workers", "4", "--worker-class", "uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8000"]
```

### 2. Custom Wrapper using Gunicorn Application Class

For more complex setups or specific customization needs, consider wrapping the application by extending Gunicorn’s `Application` class

This approach allows fine-grained control over Gunicorn’s configuration, which is helpful when tuning for production or needing specific deployment setups.

In the `Dockerfile`, specify the command to run the custom wrapper script:
```Dockerfile
CMD ["python", "main.py"]
```
