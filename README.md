# Deploying FastAPI with Gunicorn and Uvicorn Workers

## Goals

- Achieve efficient and scalable request handling.
- Leverage asynchronous processing capabilities.
- Ensure robust and reliable process management.

## Task

Deploy a FastAPI application using Gunicorn as the application server with Uvicorn workers to handle asynchronous requests in a production environment.

## Reasons

- **Process Management**: Utilize Gunicorn's mature process management for handling multiple worker processes.
- **Asynchronous Support**: Benefit from Uvicorn's high-performance asynchronous processing for improved performance.
- **Scalability**: Handle increased traffic efficiently by running multiple workers.
- **Performance**: Achieve high throughput and low latency in request handling.
- **Flexibility**: Customize server configurations to suit specific application needs.
